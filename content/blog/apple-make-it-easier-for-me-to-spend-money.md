To buy an app from the Mac App Store, I'm having to jump through hoops. As of writing this, I still haven't managed to buy the app I want.

I saw this [Tweet](https://twitter.com/mizko/status/1642699100763344896?s=20) that showcased a new, simple app that adds audible keystroke sounds whenever you type on your Mac. It sounds silly and dumb, but I absolutely wanted it. And it certainly didn't help that the app, Klack, had a beautiful [product page](https://tryklack.com/).

So, I go to buy the app which is distributed via the Mac App Store. After entering my Apple ID and password (if I'm already signed into the App Store, why is this necessary?), I get hit with a message stating, "Verification Required. To complete your purchase, verify your payment information."

I've had this message before. I'm in an Apple Family where an Apple Card is used as the family payment method. I, however, don't want to use the family payment method; I want to verify and use my own card. Alas, that isn't an option.

In an attempt to circumvent this arbitrary limitation, I added a few dollars to my Apple ID — enough to cover the cost of the app. I was still prompted for verification.

As I knew I wouldn't be able to get in contact with my Apple Family's organizer for a few hours, I started a conversation with Apple Support. In the end, the agent suggested I leave my Apple Family, make the purchase, and then re-join. It's comical to have the official support recommend this incredibly inconvenient "solution."

This entire ordeal left me feeling dumbfounded, and it's not even the first time I've gone through it. Apple, why do you make it so difficult to spend money on your platform? Sideloading on iOS cannot come soon enough; clearly, Apple needs competition to encourage improvements to their App Stores.

*(In case I didn't make it clear, the solution to this problem is to allow family members to verify and use their own payment methods.)*
