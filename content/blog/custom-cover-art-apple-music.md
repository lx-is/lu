As Apple Music evolved from iTunes, it kept much of the functionality Apple permitted to its users to manage their purchased music. One specific feature, which I feel is overlooked and underrated, is the ability to change the artwork of any song or album in your library.

The way Apple Music works is, if you add a piece of media to your library, it functions sort of as if you own it; you can do with it as you please, for the most part.

### Case in point

A recent personal favorite song of mine is "Nevermind" by Presley Regier. While I think the song is great, I felt its cover art was mediocre and didn't really fit the vibe.

So, I changed the cover to something I felt was more fitting: an upscaled and cropped screenshot from one of the first frames of the music video.

I think the end result is perfect âœ¨

### How to do it

Once you have a 1x1 image you'd like to use, it's pretty simple to apply (Apple recommends an image of 4000x4000, but a lower resolution is perfectly fine).

1. In the Music app on macOS, open the song/album that you'd like to change in your library (don't open it from search/discovery).
2. Hit the three dots more info button and select "Get Info."
3. A metadata window will pop up, and, from there, simply go to the artwork tab and select your image.

Now, as long as you play the song from your library, it will have your modifications. So, if you are to add it to a playlist, make sure to add it from your library and not search/discovery.

I'm unsure if any other platform clients allow you to edit metadata. Maybe iTunes on Windows.

### Tidbits

- Even with modifications, the song will still update from Apple Music. If, for example, the song gets the fancy new lyric experience, the modified song will still reflect those updates.
- The change(s) don't really take place in the Apple Music web player. It appears in some places, but not most.
- It works with AirPlay.
