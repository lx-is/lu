For context, music is a relatively new experience for me. I really only got into regularly listening to music within the past year. I'm sure to most that sounds insane.

I'd like to say my musical taste is eclectic. I listen to alternative, pop, ambient, electronic, lofi, and some rock and classical. As well, a lot of the music I listen to is outside my native language. I tend not to listen to rap and I strongly dislike country.

I hope you, whoever reading this, adds at least one of these songs to your playlist :)
