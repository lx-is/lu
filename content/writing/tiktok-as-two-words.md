I’ve noticed some people appear to distance themselves from TikTok by spelling out the social media platform derisively as "tik tok."

Maybe doing so is less prevalent than I think it is, but it’s something I’ve seen particularly around privacy and security circles.

Perhaps there’s actually nothing to it; they might simply think that’s the correct spelling or just haven’t given much thought to the official branding or correct spelling. Fair enough. Though, I’d argue TikTok is just as prevalent as Facebook — which is never spelt as "face book."

My personal theory is that the incorrect spelling is done as a way to emphasise their detachment from the social media platform. If this is the case, I don't have any animosity towards it. Language is fascinating; it’s neat to see how spelling can be used as a way to signal one’s preferences and affiliations.
